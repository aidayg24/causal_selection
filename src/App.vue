    <InstructionScreen :title="'Welcome'">
  <p><strong>Welcome, and thank you for participating!</strong><br/>
  This experiment will take about <strong>20 minutes</strong> to complete.</p>

  <p>In this experiment, you will read about games between two players</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Each player can make certain moves.</li>
    <li>Depending on their moves, <strong>points are awarded</strong> </li>
    <li>Each game also has a <strong>win rule</strong>, which tells us how a player can win.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You will be shown:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The rules of the game </li>
    <li>What moves the players made</li>
    <li>The resulting points and outcome</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Based on this information, you will be asked to <strong>make judgments</strong> about the game.</p>

  <p>Before the main experiment begins, you will complete <strong>3 practice questions</strong> 
  to get familiar with the rules.</p>

    Alice and Bob are playing a small game. Both have two cards and they can pick one of them. In the image below you can see the points for each move:<br/>

  Well done on the practice round! Now we can begin the main experiment. <br/><br/>

In this part, two players are taking part in a <em>‚ÄúCard Game.‚Äù</em>
Each player has a deck of 10 cards. Every deck contains only two types of emojis, and the players cannot see the emojis. The exact number of each emoji is unknown to them. <br/><br/>

In each round, both players draw one card at random. Then a short report will tell you: <br/>

which cards the players drew, and <br/>

one sentence from a Reporter, who knows all 20 cards, that explains who won and why. <br/><br/>

<strong>Your task: Based on the report, estimate how many of each emoji are in each player‚Äôs deck.</strong> <br/><br/>

<strong>Please answer according to your own judgment.</strong>
There are no right or wrong answers. <br/><br/>

Let‚Äôs get started!

  Now the game center has created a new game with new players and new rules! <br/><br/>

In this game, each player builds their own deck of 10 cards. They must always choose 2 cards of one emoji and 8 cards of the other emoji. No other combinations are allowed. <br/><br/>

After the players set their decks, the cards are shuffled. Then a Judge, who does not know how the decks are divided, decides the point system. The Judge chooses which emoji will give points and which will not. <br/><br/>

Once this is done, each player flips one card. <br/><br/>

<strong>Your task: Based on what happens in the play, answer the questions that follow.</strong> <br/><br/>
