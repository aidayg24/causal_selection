    <InstructionScreen :title="'Welcome'">
  <p><strong>Welcome, and thank you for participating!</strong><br/>
  This experiment will take about <strong>20 minutes</strong> to complete.</p>

  <p>In this experiment, you will read about games between two players</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Each player can make certain moves.</li>
    <li>Depending on their moves, <strong>points are awarded</strong> </li>
    <li>Each game also has a <strong>win rule</strong>, which tells us how a player can win.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You will be shown:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The rules of the game </li>
    <li>What moves the players made</li>
    <li>The resulting points and outcome</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Based on this information, you will be asked to <strong>make judgments</strong> about the game.</p>

  <p>Before the main experiment begins, you will complete <strong>3 practice questions</strong> 
  to get familiar with the rules.</p>

  <p>üëâ Click <strong>Next</strong> to start the trial questions!</p>

    Alice and Bob are playing a small game. Both have two cards, and they can pick one of them. In the image below, you can see the points for each move:<br/>

  Well done on the practice round! Now we can begin the main experiment.<br/><br/>

In this part, two players are taking part in a <em>‚ÄúChoosing Game.‚Äù</em>  
Each player has two possible options, and they must choose one of them.  
The options for each player will be explained in the scenario.<br/><br/>

For each question, you will be shown a short report that tells you: <br/>  
- which options the players chose, and <br/>  
- a one-sentence explanation of what caused the result of the game. <br/><br/>

<strong>Your task: Imagine the players had played the same game 10 times before.  
Based on the report, estimate how often each player would typically choose their options. </strong> <br/><br/>

<strong>Please answer according to your own judgment.</strong>  
There are no right or wrong answers. <br/><br/>
